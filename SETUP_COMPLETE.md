## 🛠 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Fix Admin Access

Choose one of these methods to make yourself an admin:

#### Method A: Browser Console Script (Easiest)
1. Open your deployed app in a browser
2. Log in with your account
3. Open Developer Tools (F12) → Console
4. Copy and paste the entire `create-admin.js` script into the console
5. Run: `createAdminUser('your-email@example.com')`

#### Method B: Supabase Dashboard (Direct)
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to: **Table Editor** → **profiles**
3. Find your user row (search by email)
4. Change the `role` column from `'user'` to `'admin'`
5. Save changes

#### Method C: SQL Query
In Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor:
```sql
UPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### Step 2: Test the Application

1. **Test Cart Notifications:**
   - Add any book to cart
   - Should see toast notification: "Book Title added to cart!"
   - Notification includes author name and price

2. **Test Admin Access:**
   - Navigate to `/admin`
   - Should see admin dashboard (not "Access Denied")
   - All admin functions should be available

3. **Test Policy Pages:**
   - Visit `/privacy` - should show Privacy Policy
   - Visit `/returns` - should show Returns Policy
   - Both pages should be fully formatted and responsive

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Still Getting "Access Denied" 
**Solution:**

4. Clear browser cache and log out/in

### Issue: Toast Notifications Not Showing
**Solution:**
1. Refresh the page - Toaster component should be loaded
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Make sure you're on the latest deployed version

### Issue: Policy Pages Show 404
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you've deployed the latest version
2. Check that the files exist in the `app/privacy/` and `app/returns/` directories
3. Firebase might need a few minutes to update routes
