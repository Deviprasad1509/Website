2. **Delete old tables** by running this command:
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.user_library CASCADE;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.order_items CASCADE;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.orders CASCADE;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.ebooks CASCADE;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.categories CASCADE;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.profiles CASCADE;
   DROP TYPE IF EXISTS public.user_role CASCADE;
   DROP TYPE IF EXISTS public.payment_status CASCADE;
   ```

3. **Run the new schema** from `NEW_SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql`
   - Copy the entire content of `NEW_SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql`
   - Paste it into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click "Run"

### 2. Create Your First Admin User

1. **Sign up** through your website with your admin email
2. **In Supabase SQL Editor**, run:

   UPDATE public.profiles 
   SET role = 'admin' 
   WHERE email = 'your-admin-email@example.com';
   ```
3. **Verify** the admin was created:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, email, first_name, last_name, role 
   FROM public.profiles 
   WHERE role = 'admin';
   ```
