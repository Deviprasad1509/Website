## 🚀 **Next Steps (The Only Thing Left)**

**Razorpay Payment Integration** - You mentioned you'll handle this later. When ready:

1. Set up your Razorpay account
2. Add environment variables for Razorpay keys

4. Update the order status after successful payment
5. Automatically add books to user library after payment

## 🛠 **How to Set Up & Run**

### **1. Database Setup**
Follow the detailed instructions in `DATABASE_SETUP.md` to:

```

### **3. Install & Run**
```bash
