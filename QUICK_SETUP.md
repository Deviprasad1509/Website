# 🚀 Quick Setup Instructions

## ✅ What I Fixed:

1. **Cleaned up environment files** - removed duplicates, left clean templates
2. **Simplified auth context** - removed complex retry logic that was causing issues
3. **Added debugging console logs** - to help track auth state transitions
4. **Added debug panel** - for easy testing (only shows in development)

## 🔧 What You Need to Do:

### 1. Update Environment Variables
Edit `.env.local` and replace these placeholder values with your new Supabase project:

```bash
# Replace these with your actual Supabase project values
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-new-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-new-anon-key-here
```

### 2. Get Your Supabase Credentials
1. Go to your new Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings > API**
3. Copy the **Project URL** 
4. Copy the **anon public** key

### 3. Run the SQL Schema
1. Go to **SQL Editor** in Supabase
2. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-schema-fixed.sql`
3. Click **Run**

### 4. Test the Setup
1. Run the app locally: `npm run dev`
2. You'll see a debug panel in the bottom-right corner
3. Click **"Test DB"** to verify database connection
4. Try creating a test user with the debug panel

### 5. Create Admin User
After testing works:
1. Sign up through the app or create user in Supabase Auth
2. Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
UPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your-admin-email@example.com';
```

## 🐛 Debugging:

### Check Browser Console
The auth context now logs detailed information:
- ✅ Profile loaded successfully
- ✅ Profile created successfully  
- ❌ Database connection errors
- ❌ Authentication failures

### Use Debug Panel (Development Only)
- Shows current auth state
- Test database connection
- Test login/signup
- View test results in real-time

### Common Issues:

**Environment Variables Not Loading:**
- Make sure `.env.local` is in the root directory
- Restart the dev server after changing env variables
- Check for typos in variable names

**Database Connection Fails:**
- Verify Supabase URL and key are correct
- Check that the SQL schema ran successfully
- Verify tables were created in Supabase dashboard

**Profile Not Created After Login:**
- Check the `handle_new_user()` trigger exists
- Verify RLS policies are properly applied
- Look for database errors in Supabase logs

## 🧹 Clean Up After Testing:

Once everything works, remove the debug panel:

1. Remove `import { AuthDebugComponent } from "@/components/debug-auth"` from `app/layout.tsx`
2. Remove `<AuthDebugComponent />` from the JSX
3. Remove the console.log statements from `lib/auth-context.tsx`
4. Delete `components/debug-auth.tsx`

## 🚀 Deploy:

After testing locally:
```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

Your app will be live and fully functional! 🎉
